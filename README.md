# Description

This is a recipe website noting some favorite recipes of mine 
made by Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt. It has four pages, a homepage and 3 recipe 
pages. The homepage has a picture of Kenji, a short description, and 
links to the other three recipes that are easy, intermediate, and hard.

Each of the recipe pages has a title, picture of the finished dish, a 
one paragraph description of the dish, and three main sections, 
"Ingredients", "Steps", and "Notes". The hard recipe has an additional 
"Special Equipment" section. Each page also has a link to the original 
recipe and a link to go back to the homepage.
