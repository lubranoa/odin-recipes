    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Red beans and rice is one of my favorite Cajun dishes of all time. It's the kind
        of dish that is so hearty and soul-warming that it makes you feel like you just 
        crawled into a cozy blanket right out of the dryer. This specific recipe comes 
        from one of my favorite chefs, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt. He goes to incredible lengths 
        to keep recipes as authentic as possible but always provides multiple (and sometimes 
        easier) ways to achieve similar results if you don't have certain ingredients 
        available to you or you don't have the time to devote to a recipe. I would highly 
        recommend his cookbook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087">The Food Lab</a>. 
        It is a guide to understanding cooking better through a scientific lens. Many of 
        his recipes are also available on <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com">Serious Eats</a>, 
        a food and drink blog and recipe resource.

        Enough with the plugs, let's get to this recipe. It starts off with Cajun cooking's 
        "holy trinity" of vegetables, onion, celery, and green bell pepper. Much like France's 
        mirepoix (onion, celery, and carrot), it is the main flavor base of most Cajun cuisine, 
        hence the holy trinity moniker. This is the flavor backbone of the dish, tying all the 
        major flavors together subtly and over time as the dish simmers. Beyond that we have 
        garlic, cayenne pepper, sage, black pepper, thyme, bay leaves, and andouille sausage, among 
        others that turn beans and rice into something otherworldly.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) red kidney beans (dried or canned; see note)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil or lard</li>
        <li>1 pound (about 450g) cooked andouille sausage, cut into 1/2-inch disks</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped (about 12 ounces; 340g)</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)</li>
        <li>4 ribs celery, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)</li>
        <li>4 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon (3 to 15g) ground cayenne pepper (depending on how hot you like it)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (about 4g) ground sage</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 smoked ham hock (optional; see note)</li>
        <li>8 ounces (225g) pickled pork shoulder or rind (optional; see note)</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Hot sauce, such as Crystal or Frank's, to taste</li>
        <li>Cider vinegar, to taste (optional; see note)</li>
        <li>Cooled white rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            If using dried beans, place them in a large bowl and cover with 6 cups of cold water 
            and 2 tablespoons (30g) kosher salt. Stir until salt is dissolved. Set aside at 
            room temp for 8 to 16 hours. Drain and rinse. If using canned, drain and rinse 
            the beans and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large dutch oven, heat oil or lard over medium-high heat until shimmering.</li>
        <li>Add andouille sausage and cook, stirring, until lightly browned about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Add onion, celery, bell pepper, and a large pinch of salt and cook, stirring, 
            until vegetables have softened and are just starting to brown around the edges, 
            about 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 45 seconds.</li>
        <li>
            Add, cayenne pepper, sage, and a generous 10 to 12 grinds of fresh black 
            pepper. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add beans, along with enough water to cover them by about 2 inches, thyme, bay 
            leaves, ham hock (if using), and pickled pork (if using). Bring to a boil, then 
            reduce to a bare simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and cook until beans are completely tender, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours (older 
            beans can take longer), stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has thickened 
            and turned creamy, about 20 minutes. If the pot starts to look dry before the stew 
            turns creamy, add a cup of water and continue simmering. Repeat as necessary until 
            desired level of creaminess is achieved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Discard bay leaves and thyme stems. Take out ham hock if used, remove meat from 
            bones and add back to pot if desired. The ham hock will be very hot so be careful 
            with this step.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season to taste with hot sauce, a few teaspoons of cider vinegar (if using), and 
            more salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            For best texture, let cool and refrigerate overnight. Reheat the next day, adding 
            a little water to loosen to desired consistency.
        </li>
        <li>Serve red beans over steamed white rice.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can make a quicker version with canned beans, but if you want really creamy 
            texture and the best flavor, dried beans are the way to go.
        </li>
        <li>
            Smoked ham hock can add more smokiness to the dish. The meat between the bones is 
            porky and delicious but is optional if you don't want to do the work to get it out. 
            It does add some salt to the red beans as well, so watch the salt when adding to taste at the end.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pickled pork can be difficult to find, and the red beans can easily be made without 
            it. If you're omitting the pickled pork, a small splash of cider vinegar can help 
            brighten the flavor of the beans, but is not completely necessary. Add it to suit 
            your own taste.
        </li>
    </ul>
