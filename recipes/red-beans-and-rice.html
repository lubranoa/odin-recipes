    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Red beans and rice is a staple dish of New Orleans cuisine. As with most 
        recipes around the world, there can be many variations of one dish depending 
        on locale, time of year, family influence on traditions, to name a few. Generally, 
        its main ingredients are red kidney beans, rice, and andouille sausage, a smoked 
        pork sausage typically associated with Cajun cuisine. This is the way I ate it 
        growing up in a Cajun family (now residing in Houston, Texas, but Cajun 
        nonetheless). The dish itself is hearty, relatively spicy, and warms your heart and 
        soul as it's consumed bite by bite. Depending on what meats are used, it can be
        smoky as well.

        This specific recipe comes from one of my favorite chefs, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt. He 
        goes to incredible lengths to keep recipes as authentic as possible but always 
        provides multiple ways to achieve similar results if you don't have certain
        ingredients available to you or you don't have the time to devote to a recipe. 
        I would highly recommend his cookbook, 
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087">The Food Lab</a>. 
        It is a guide to understanding cooking better through a scientific lens. Many of 
        his recipes are also available on <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com">Serious Eats</a>, 
        a food and drink blog and recipe resource.

        Enough with the plugs, let's get to this recipe. It starts off with Cajun cooking's 
        "holy trinity" of vegetables, onion, celery, and green bell pepper. Much like France's 
        mirepoix (onion, celery, and carrot), it is the main flavor base of most Cajun cuisine, 
        hence the holy trinity moniker. This is the flavor backbone of the dish, tying all the 
        major flavors together subtly and over time as the dish simmers. Beyond that we have 
        garlic, cayenne pepper, sage, black pepper, thyme, bay leaves, andouille sausage, among 
        others that turn beans and rice into something otherworldly.
