    <h1>3-Ingredient Mac & Cheese</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is another one of my favorites by Kenji, an easy stovetop mac and cheese 
        that is sure to get your gears turning. This only has 3 major ingredients so it
        will not take much work to make. Don't worry if the pasta seems like it will 
        need more water to cook it in. There's a method to Kenji's madness in that 
        reducing the amount of water concentrates the starches that come out of the 
        pasta when boiling. This concentrated starch will help the sauce stay creamy 
        and emulsified. Without the starch, the cheese may turn tough and greasy. Just 
        make sure to stir frequently to keep the pasta from sticking.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>6 ounces (170g) elbow macaroni</li>
       <li>Salt</li>
       <li>6 ounces (180ml) evaporated milk</li>
       <li>
           6 ounce (170g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good melting 
           cheese, like Fontina, Gruyere, or Jack
       </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold 
            water to cover the pasta
        </li>
        <li>Add pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently</li>
        <li>
            Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed 
            and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes
        </li>
        <li>Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil</li>
        <li>
            Add cheese and reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until 
            cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes 
            longer
        </li>
        <li>Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Note</h2>

        <li>
            If you are willing to add a few other ingredients, try adding a teaspoon to 
            tablespoon of hot sauce (like Frank's or Louisiana), some mustard powder, or
            a knob of butter stirred in with the evaporated milk.
        </li>
    </ul>
