    These recipes come from one of my favorite chefs, J. Kenji López-Alt. He goes to 
    great lengths to keep recipes as authentic as possible but always provides multiple 
    (and sometimes easier) ways to achieve similar results if certain ingredients are
    not available to you. I would highly recommend his cookbook, 
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087">The Food Lab</a>.
    It is a guide to understanding cooking better through a scientific lens. Many of 
    his recipes are also available on 
    <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com">Serious Eats</a>,
    a food and drink blog and recipe resource.
